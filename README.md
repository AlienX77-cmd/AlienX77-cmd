**In the world full of chaos, who shall bring it to an end?, who will be ruled and who will be the conqueror?
Only the next great war will grant the absolute power to the greatest victor and I have been waiting for this moment for my whole life.
I only swing my sword once, but I have sharpened it for more than ten years.**
